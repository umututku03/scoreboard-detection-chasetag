# Scoreboard Detection Project
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting scoreboards in images using a dot product-based image comparison technique. By applying a predefined mask to a scoreboard template, the script enhances the template-matching process, allowing for the precise identification of scoreboards within broader images.

## Features
Template and Mask Usage: Utilizes a template of the scoreboard along with a mask to focus on relevant features.
Dot Product Comparison: Employs a dot product calculation to measure the similarity between the masked template and specific regions of target images.

## Usage
Load the images, apply the mask to the template, crop the desired region from the image, and compute the dot product to assess similarity. Adjust the ROI coordinates and mask as necessary for different images.

This concise approach provides a straightforward overview of the project without delving into unnecessary details, ensuring clarity of purpose and basic usage.
